The AI engineer successfully transformed ThriveBrands-BIZ Pulse into BeaconIQ by Vector AI Studio. Initial efforts involved building the FastAPI/React application from scratch, handling Azure Blob data ingestion, and MongoDB synchronization. Key challenges included debugging data column inconsistencies, managing UI redesigns (vertical sidebar, dark blue/gold scheme, then white/amber BeaconIQ style), and resolving persistent data loading issues. The engineer implemented AI assistant features, various analytics pages, and new sections like Cockpit and Projects. Significant debugging occurred around database connections (old vs. new databases,  issues), column name mismatches between backend Pandas and MongoDB schema, and ensuring correct dummy/static data population. The focus shifted from dynamic data to a static data showcase. The final task initiated was reconstructing the Projects page.

The objective is to build BeaconIQ by Vector AI Studio, an AI-powered Business Intelligence Portal. It processes 3-year data (originally from Azure Blob, now static/sample data) covering business, channel, customer, brand, category, and KPIs like Revenue, Gross Profit, and Units. The portal features a filterable dashboard with diverse charts. Key sections include Business Compass (Executive Overview), Customer Analysis, Brand Analysis, Category Analysis, Reports, Cockpit, Projects, Sales Analysis, and Root Cause Analysis. A floating Ask VectorDeep AI assistant offers insights. The UI is clean, minimalistic, and futuristic, following a white background with amber highlights (BeaconIQ style), featuring a vertical sidebar, multi-select filters, and colorful charts. Authentication uses  / . Data display includes 2025 values, thousand separators, and Euro/Dollar formatting. New pages like Cockpit and Projects integrate AI. The Business Compass now has extensive key metrics and charts with individual and global filters. All pages must load data, initially from MongoDB, now from static files for showcase.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully transitioned the entire portal to use static data for showcase purposes. This involved creating a new file, , which now serves as the single source of truth for all data displayed on the frontend. The backend database connection and data fetching logic were effectively bypassed by updating all relevant frontend pages: , , , , , and  were modified to import and utilize this static data.

This static data implementation followed a complex phase of debugging and feature additions. Previous work included:
1.  **Rebranding** the portal to BeaconIQ by Vector AI Studio.
2.  Implementing **multi-select filters** across various pages.
3.  Adding new pages like **Sales Analysis** and **Root Cause Analysis**.
4.  Extensive **data loading fixes**, which involved debugging MongoDB connections, column name mismatches between Pandas and MongoDB, and ensuring the correct database () was used.
5.  Enhancing the **Business Compass** page with new metrics, charts, and filtering capabilities.
6.  Ensuring all charts displayed with **colorful themes**.

The last explicit request from the user is to reconstruct the  page. The engineer has acknowledged this and is poised to begin this task, building a comprehensive showcase version with Top Projects, Business Planner, and Campaign Cockpit sections.
