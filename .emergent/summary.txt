The AI engineer successfully built an interactive Business Intelligence Portal, ThriveBrands-BIZ Pulse, from scratch using a FastAPI backend and React frontend. The initial phase focused on data ingestion from Azure Blob Storage, setting up the core application structure, and implementing basic analytics pages with KPI cards. Significant effort was dedicated to debugging and refining the data synchronization process, including addressing column name inconsistencies and numeric type conversions from the CSV data.

A major iterative cycle involved a complete UI redesign, shifting from a horizontal to a vertical navigation sidebar, implementing a white background with a blue header, and integrating dynamic charts using Chart.js after initial rendering issues with Recharts. The AI assistant and interactive insight modals were implemented and refined. The current phase involves a substantial restructuring to add advanced features like Cockpit (campaign management) and Projects (task management), along with a new dark blue and gold color scheme, during which a syntax error in  was encountered and is currently being addressed.

The goal is to develop ThriveBrands-BIZ Pulse, an AI-powered Business Intelligence Portal. It processes 3-year CSV data from Azure Blob Storage, organized by Year, Month, Business, Channel, Customer, Brand, Category, and KPIs like fGP, gSales, Cases. The portal requires:
- A web-based, filterable dashboard with charts (Bar, Line, Area, Pie/Donut).
- Menu sections: Executive Overview, Customer Analysis, Brand Analysis, Category Analysis, Reports, Cockpit, Projects.
- An AI Assistant (Ask VectorDeep AI) floating button on every page, providing insights, forecasts, and email drafting capabilities.
- UI: Clean, futuristic, minimalistic dashboard feel with a professional color palette (Primary Blue #184464, Accent Blue #538EB7, Highlight Gold #B1864E, Accent Teal #0091A7), later updated to dark blue header and gold accents. Responsive design, intuitive filtering.
- Backend: Data connection to Azure Blob, filterable/exportable insights/charts, editable product/customer tables.
- Authentication: Username , password .
- Data should show 2025 data, use thousand separators, and display values in Euro with k/M suffixes.
- New features include a vertical navigation sidebar, horizontal filter bar in content, collapsible sidebar, Cockpit page for campaign management (AI-recommended, active, archived), and a Project Management system (task creation, AI recommendations).

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of a major portal restructuring and new feature implementation. This includes:
1.  **Layout Redesign**: Transitioning from a horizontal navigation to a vertical, collapsible sidebar on the left, with a horizontal filter bar positioned at the top of the main content area. The main navbar is being updated to remove horizontal tabs.
2.  **New Pages**: Creating two significant new pages:  for campaign management and  for project management, both intended to integrate AI recommendations.
3.  **Color Scheme Update**: Applying a new color scheme featuring a dark blue header bar and gold accents for selection states and AI-related buttons/elements.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully written files for , , , and updated  routes. Styling changes were also applied to , , and  buttons. The work was interrupted by a detected syntax error in  (), which the engineer is actively attempting to fix, as confirmed by the last message in the trajectory.
